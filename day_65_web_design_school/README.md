## Key Concepts

### 1. Hierarchy

Hierarchy helps users quickly identify the most important information. This can be achieved through:
- **Size:** Larger elements attract attention first.
- **Color:** Contrasting or accent colors highlight key actions or information.
- **Shape and Boldness:** Square, bold, or uniquely shaped elements stand out.

**Example:**  
E-commerce sites like ASOS use muted backgrounds with bright accent colors (e.g., green "Add to bag" buttons) to direct user focus.

### 2. Layout

A good layout breaks content into manageable sections, mixing text with images and varying element sizes. This improves readability and keeps users engaged.

- **Optimal line length:** 40–60 characters per line for comfortable reading.
- **Example:** Grammarly’s website uses short text blocks and visuals for easy information absorption.

### 3. Alignment

Consistent alignment of elements (titles, text, images) creates a cohesive and professional appearance. Reducing the number of alignment points and using grid lines helps maintain order and clarity.

### 4. White Space

White space (empty areas around elements) enhances clarity and elevates the perceived value of content. Luxury brands use white space to make products feel exclusive, while cluttered designs can feel cheap.

### 5. Designing for Your Audience

Tailor your design to the preferences and expectations of your target audience. For example:
- Use playful colors and fonts for children’s content.
- Opt for clean, professional styles for business or medical websites.
