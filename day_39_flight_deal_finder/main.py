"""
This script is an application for searching cheap flights using the Flight Search API. 
It integrates with a Google Sheet to manage flight data and uses Twilio to send SMS notifications 
for flight deals.
Modules:
- datetime: For handling date and time operations.
- os: For interacting with the operating system.
- flight_data: Contains functionality to find the cheapest flight.
- flight_search: Handles flight search operations using the Flight Search API.
- data_manager: Manages data storage and retrieval from a Google Sheet.
- notification_manager: Sends notifications via SMS using Twilio.
Classes:
- DataManager: Handles data retrieval and updates for the Google Sheet.
- FlightSearch: Provides methods to search for flights and retrieve IATA codes.
- NotificationManager: Sends SMS notifications for flight deals.
Workflow:
1. Retrieve flight data from a Google Sheet using the DataManager.
2. Update missing IATA codes in the Google Sheet by fetching them from the Flight Search API.
3. Search for flights for each destination over a specified date range (from tomorrow to six months from today).
4. Identify the cheapest flight for each destination.
5. Compare the flight price with the lowest price recorded in the Google Sheet.
6. If a cheaper flight is found, send an SMS notification with the flight details.
Note:
- The script pauses for 2 seconds after updating each IATA code to avoid hitting API rate limits.
- Ensure that the required API keys and credentials for the Flight Search API, Google Sheets API, and Twilio are properly configured.
